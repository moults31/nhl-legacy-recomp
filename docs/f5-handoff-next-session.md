## You are here (1 paragraph)

The EDRAM-free plume path **renders live dense gameplay correctly** (user-confirmed: players render
right; remaining flicker/texture gaps are PRE-EXISTING parity items for F-5-parity, not regressions).
Performance is **~15–16 fps dense (~1500 draws, ~64 ms/frame)**. We proved this session the frame is
**CPU-bound on the single CP thread** (~92% busy, only ~5 ms/frame GPU-wait), split ~34 ms our
per-draw extraction + ~25 ms SDK PM4 decode. The **renderer is NOT the bottleneck** (plume render ~8 ms
contended / ~1 ms exclusive; F-6 spike hit 165–650 fps). Two perf passes landed (whole-packet draw cache
= menu-only, gated off; by-id geometry streaming = shipped, correct, but ~flat on fps because the
per-frame hash-read replaced the copy). **The wall is the per-draw CPU FEED, single-threaded.**

## The decision waiting for you — the DECISIVE spike

**Does the per-draw producer extraction (~34 ms) parallelize off the CP thread?** This single result
determines whether 60 fps is on the table. Everything else (F-4, micro-opts) is secondary until this is
answered.

- **The work** (`RenderBetaOwnedDraw`: translate / gap1 tex-binding+gather / untile / packet) is largely
  per-draw-independent → in principle parallelizable across ~8 cores → ~34 ms could drop to ~5–8 ms,
  leaving the ~25 ms SDK decode as the wall (~30 ms/frame → ~33 fps), then F-4 trims further.
- **The risk the spike must surface:** the work reads SHARED MUTABLE SDK state that the SDK rewrites
  between draws — `register_file_` (the 0x4000/0x4800/0x2000 blocks we hash+copy), `beta_current_vs_`,
  and the static producer caches (`s_texCache`, the `HcXlatEntry` translate cache, `s_sentGeo`/
  `s_sentRes`). To move the work off-thread you must (a) SNAPSHOT each draw's inputs on the CP thread
  (copy the needed register ranges + buffer pointers + shader handles), (b) hand to a worker pool, (c)
  make the caches thread-safe (shard/lock). **The snapshot copy (~register ranges × 1500 draws) could
  itself eat the win** — that's exactly what the spike measures.
- **Cheap decisive form:** on the CP thread, snapshot just the inputs translate+untile+packet need into
  a per-draw struct and push to a pool; do the work there; keep the CP thread to (SDK decode + snapshot
  + enqueue). Measure the CP-thread wall (the existing `NHL_HIGHCUT_BUSYPROBE` already reports it). If it
  drops toward ~25–30 ms → parallelization works → pursue it. If snapshot/sync overhead keeps it ~flat →
  parallelization is blocked by the shared-state coupling → 60 fps needs the leaner-custom-decoder path.

### ✅ F-5b SHIPPED (commit `a372fb9`) — the snapshot-cost probe (do this measurement FIRST)

The pool's whole bet hinges on **how expensive the snapshot is** — and that's measurable WITHOUT building
the pool. `NHL_HIGHCUT_SNAPPROBE` (in `RenderBetaOwnedDraw`, just after the index gather) per draw memcpys
exactly the bytes a worker would need — the register banks (`regs[0x2000..0x2400]` + `regs[0x4000..0x4940]`)
+ the full guest **vertex** + **index** bytes — into a reusable scratch buffer, times it on the CP thread,
and reports `ms/frame` + `MB/frame` in the 60-frame window (next to BUSYPROBE). Rendering is unchanged
(scratch discarded). It's the **worst-case** snapshot (copies full vtx/idx, not the deduped by-id
artifacts) = an UPPER bound on the post-MT CP-thread floor.

- **Run it:** `scripts\_snapprobe.ps1` → drive into dense gameplay, hold ~30 s, close. Read
  `[highcut-perf] SNAPPROBE: per-draw input snapshot = N ms/frame …` against our ~34 ms.
- **Decision rule:**
  - snapshot **<< ~34 ms** (say ≤ ~8 ms) → byte copy is cheap → **MT producer is GO** (build the pool;
    post-MT CP wall → ~SDK-decode 25 ms + snapshot → ~30 ms → ~33 fps, then F-4 trims).
  - snapshot **≈ ~34 ms** → the raw copy alone is as costly as the work → **threads don't help**; 60 fps
    needs the leaner custom PM4 decoder. THEN: re-run with a **deduped** snapshot model (copy only the
    register banks + by-id ids, skip full vtx/idx — most static draws are already-sent geometry) as a
    cheaper floor before abandoning the pool.
- **Why this is the right first step:** it de-risks the pool. If snapshot ≈ work, building a thread-safe
  worker pool (shard/lock `s_texCache`/xlat caches) would have been wasted effort on a doomed approach.
  Needs the user at the controller (autonomous attract is too light to be representative).

### ★★ F-5b RESULT — DENSE CONTROLLER RUN 2026-06-23: **MT PRODUCER IS GO (decisive)**

Log `t241432`, ~1300–1660 draws/frame, ~14–19 fps, ~50–66 ms/frame CP-busy. The worst-case input
snapshot costs **~1.0–1.2 ms/frame** (30–38 MB) — **~30× cheaper than our ~34 ms of per-draw work**.
The byte copy is a non-issue (pure memcpy bandwidth). Context held steady with prior runs: CP-thread
CPU-busy 92–95%, blocked (coexist GPU wait) only ~3–5 ms, of CPU-busy our RenderBetaOwnedDraw ~26–37 ms
+ SDK-PM4-decode ~23–29 ms.

**Implication — the projected ceiling:** move our ~34 ms onto a worker pool ⇒ post-MT CP wall ≈
SDK-decode (~25 ms) + snapshot (~1 ms) ≈ **~26 ms ⇒ ~38 fps** (from ~15–16 ⇒ ~2.4×). The ~25 ms SDK
PM4 decode stays serial on the CP thread (upstream of the snapshot), so **~34–40 fps is the MT-producer
ceiling**; 60 fps still needs F-4 (cut the throwaway base-render slice of the ~25 ms) and/or the leaner
custom decoder. But MT alone is a large, real win and is now GO with evidence.

**The MT producer build (next):**
1. **Snapshot struct** per draw on the CP thread: the two register ranges + guest vtx/idx bytes (≈ what
   SNAPPROBE copies) + shader handles/ids + a monotonically-increasing **sequence number**.
2. **Worker pool** runs the deferred work (translate-hit / gap1 / untile-hit / packet serialize) from the
   snapshot, producing the serialized packet.
3. **Ordering:** consumer renders in push order, so workers must NOT push directly — write each packet to
   its sequence slot and **drain in sequence order** at frame commit (reorder buffer).
4. **Thread-safety of the static caches** (`s_texCache`, `s_vsXlat`/`s_psXlat`, `s_sentGeo`/`s_sentRes`,
   `s_drawPrev`/`s_drawNext`): reads dominate (100% untile-hit, by-id shaders/geo mostly seen), so a
   `shared_mutex` with read-mostly locking, or sharded maps, is cheap. **First-sight heavy work** (shader
   translate, untile, geometry gather+stream) MUTATES the caches — keep those rare paths either on the CP
   thread or behind a write-lock; the per-draw HIT path (the ~34 ms steady state) is the parallel target.
5. Gate behind a flag (`NHL_HIGHCUT_MT_PRODUCER`), keep BUSYPROBE on to confirm the CP wall drops toward
   ~26 ms. Validate with the user at the controller (geometry correctness + fps).

### ✅ MT PRODUCER — DONE (parallel ceiling reached, 2026-06-23)

Shipped `NHL_HIGHCUT_MT_PRODUCER` (default-off, opt-in): the per-draw packet production runs on a worker
thread overlapping the SDK PM4 decode. **Result: dense ~24 fps (was 16 serial, ~1.5×), light ~74 fps**,
render-correct (bounded <0.15-frame texture lag). Both busy-probes proved it's **CP-feed-bound** at dense
(CP 88–94% busy ≈ 36–39 ms/frame; worker 83–86%). Wins came from making the CP per-draw path copy/alloc-free
(lean+pooled snapshot, SPIR-V & vpi off the CP thread) + a drain-free deepened pipeline — **not** from more
workers (N workers capped at ~26–27 fps by the CP floor; not worth the complexity). **The ~25 ms SDK decode
is the wall** — only the leaner custom PM4 decoder beats it. Commits `c29e287`…`8b0cb8b`. Debug ladder:
`NHL_HIGHCUT_MT_SYNC` / `NHL_HIGHCUT_MT_LIVEREAD`; driver `scripts/_mtproducer.ps1 [-Off]`. Build/measure
detail lives in `mt-producer-stage1-plan.md` + the memory note. **Next big lever (if pursued): custom PM4
decoder; or draw-count reduction (crowd instancing / culling) for dense scenes.**

### ▶ ORIGINAL PLAN (now executed). Plan: [mt-producer-stage1-plan.md](mt-producer-stage1-plan.md)

User chose **stage it: 1 worker first, then widen** (de-risks the ~1000-line body extraction from
concurrency). Full execution spec — seam (CP thread 1405–2144 + 2922–3068; worker 2149–2920+3073–3190),
snapshot contents (full `RegisterFile` copy for Stage 1, vtx/idx bytes, vpi/result/translate-outputs),
the ~24 body redirect sites, the single-worker lifecycle, and the 1a→1b increments — is in
**`docs/mt-producer-stage1-plan.md`**. Gated `NHL_HIGHCUT_MT_PRODUCER` (default OFF = byte-identical
serial path). Target ~29 fps (Stage 1), ~38 fps (Stage 2 N-worker). Validate: `_mtproducer.ps1` (clone
`_snapprobe.ps1` + the flag), user at the controller, A/B by unsetting the flag.

## Performance reality (manage expectations)

- **Likely reachable** (MT producer + F-4 + gap1/untile micro-opts): **~30–35 fps dense**, higher on
  lighter scenes.
- **60 fps**: possible but NOT demonstrated — needs the parallel-producer win AND probably replacing the
  SDK CP front-end with a leaner custom PM4 decoder (the big rewrite in F-4's risks). Treat as a research
  goal, not a commitment.
- **CPU-bound ⇒ scales DOWN on weaker hardware** (the 4080S has GPU to spare; the bottleneck is single-
  thread CPU). Portability risk the FSI path didn't have.
- **Context:** the retired FSI/EDRAM baseline ran **66–84 fps**. The plume path inserted a whole
  extract→bridge→rebuild pipeline the baseline never paid (the ~34 ms). The bet: claw perf back AND gain
  the no-EDRAM/fold/FSI enhancement ceiling. The render headroom validates half the bet; the feed cost is
  the open half.

## The levers (with honest ceilings)

| Lever | Attacks | Ceiling | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Parallel producer** ← *do the spike first* | our ~34 ms → ~5–8 ms | ~33 fps (then SDK-decode-bound) | UNTRIED — decisive |
| F-4 exclusive plume | ~5 ms GPU-wait + some SDK base-render CPU; kills 2nd window | trims ~5–15 ms; the endgame | first-step done (busyprobe); needs the needed-decode-vs-throwaway-base-render split measured |
| gap1 micro-opt | the ~13 ms tex-binding/vfetch setup (biggest in-fn bucket) | ~5–8 ms saved | not started |
| Leaner custom PM4 decoder | the ~25 ms SDK decode (sequential, needed) | the only path PAST ~33 fps | big rewrite; F-4 fallback |
| Crowd instancing | correctness + draw count | minor perf | F-5-parity |

## Reproduce the dense measurement (NEEDS THE USER AT THE CONTROLLER)

Autonomous attract is light (≤~140 draws); dense gameplay needs a human driving + holding. Build:
`scripts\_build_highcut_ffx.bat` (target `nhllegacy`, dir `out/build/win-amd64-vk-ffx`).

- **`scripts\_f4busyprobe.ps1`** — baseline live recipe + `NHL_HIGHCUT_BUSYPROBE` (CPU-busy vs blocked).
- **`scripts\_drawcache.ps1`** — adds `NHL_HIGHCUT_GEOM_BYID` (shipped lever); `-DrawCache` adds the
  menu-only whole-packet cache; `_drawcache.ps1 0` = full-hash (zero added staleness).
- Read `[highcut-perf]` lines: `live takeover: N fps`, `window cost:` (translate/untile/packet/gap1/gap2),
  `F4-busyprobe:` (CPU-busy% + blocked + our-RenderBetaOwnedDraw-vs-SDK-decode split).

Drive into a game, hold ~30 s, close; the script greps the lines.

## GOTCHAS (don't re-pay these)

1. **`NHL_HIGHCUT_LIVE_FEED` requires `NHL_HIGHCUT_FRAME_CAPTURE`** (gated at `nhl_command_processor.cpp`
   :1686/:2733). live_feed alone = silent no-op. (Footgun TODO: OR live_feed into those gates.)
2. **Beta takeover needs the D3D12 backend** → `NHL_VK_BACKEND_OFF=1` (build auto-forces VK).
3. **Don't SW_HIDE the plume window** — stalls the game on the initial screen. The 2nd window is inherent
   to coexistence; F-4 removes it (plume → real game window).
4. **Dense gameplay = controller only.** Autonomous attract sits on light menus.
5. **Build script prints a benign `vswhere.exe` warning** — ignore; vcvars still initializes. `BUILD_EXIT=0`
   is the truth.
6. **The diagnostic `_*.ps1` scripts are gitignored** (`/scripts/_*.ps1`); force-add (`git add -f`) like
   `_vknet.ps1`/`_highcut.ps1`.

## Code map

- **Producer (CP decode → packet):** `renderer/core/nhl_command_processor.cpp::RenderBetaOwnedDraw`
  (~:1405). Per-draw flow: translate (by-id cached) → vertex/index gather (now **2-pass by-id**, hashes
  content → `vtx_id`/`idx_id`, builds copy only on first sight) → untile (`s_texCache`, 100% hit) →
  hdr build → frame-boundary commit (~:2750, present-count) → serialize+push (`HighcutLivePushDraw`).
  Perf instrumentation + `NHL_HIGHCUT_BUSYPROBE` in the per-60-frame window report.
- **Whole-packet draw cache (menu-only, gated off):** top of the `p3_dump_data` heavy block (~:2173);
  content+state hash, double-buffered by present (`s_drawPrev`/`s_drawNext`).
- **By-id geometry (shipped):** gather rebases fetch offsets + hashes in place; streams blobs via
  `HighcutLivePushResource`; consumer resolves from `c.resourceBytes`. Packet **v12**
  (`gpu/hooks/highcut_draw_packet.h`: `vtx_id`/`idx_id`).
- **Consumer (plume render):** `gpu/hooks/plume_present.cpp::BuildRenderableDraw` (~:826) + by-id caches
  (`shaderCache`/`texCache`/`resourceBytes`); `LoadC5Frames`/`RenderClear` rebuild + present.
- **D3D9 logical graph (reference, dead-end bridge per F-1.3):** `gpu/hooks/d3d9_resources.cpp`.

## This session's flags + commits

Flags (all opt-in, default behavior unchanged): `NHL_HIGHCUT_BUSYPROBE` (F-4 probe),
`NHL_HIGHCUT_DRAWCACHE`[`_HASHLEN`] (menu-only, leave off), `NHL_HIGHCUT_GEOM_BYID` (shipped lever),
**`NHL_HIGHCUT_SNAPPROBE`** (F-5b decisive snapshot-cost probe). Scripts: `_f4busyprobe.ps1`,
`_drawcache.ps1`, **`_snapprobe.ps1`**. Commits: `dfcbe46` (F-4/F-5), **`a372fb9`** (F-5b snapprobe)
on `perf/cpu-draw-submission`. The branch's pre-existing work is untouched.

**State at this handoff:** F-5b built + compiles + links clean (`BUILD_EXIT=0`, only the one TU rebuilt),
exe fresh in `out/build/win-amd64-vk-ffx`. The probe is UNMEASURED — it needs one live dense-gameplay run
(`scripts\_snapprobe.ps1`, user at the controller). That single number decides whether the MT producer
gets built. Nothing else changed; the renderer behaves identically with the flag off.
