# MT PRODUCER -- Stage 1a verification (docs/mt-producer-stage1-plan.md).
#
# 1a routes the per-draw packet production through the lifted-out ProduceLiveDrawPacket method, run
# SYNCHRONOUSLY with use_snapshot=false (reads LIVE register_file_/memory_). So this is the EXTRACTION
# FAITHFULNESS test: flag-ON must render IDENTICALLY to flag-OFF (the proven serial body). If geometry/
# textures/fps match, the ~350-line transcription is faithful and 1b (snapshot + worker thread) is just
# flipping use_snapshot=true and moving the call onto a thread.
#
# USAGE:
#   scripts\_mtproducer.ps1          # flag ON  (NHL_HIGHCUT_MT_PRODUCER=1) -- the new path
#   scripts\_mtproducer.ps1 -Off     # flag OFF (proven serial path) -- the A/B reference
#
# YOU drive into a game and HOLD in dense gameplay ~30s+, then close. Compare the two runs by eye
# (players/rink/HUD render the same?) and by the fps line. The MT path logs "[highcut-mt] live takeover
# (MT): N fps"; the serial path logs "[highcut-perf] live takeover: N fps".
#
# 1b-step2 (now default): the per-draw work runs on a WORKER THREAD overlapping the SDK PM4 decode, so
# fps should RISE (~16 -> ~29 dense) AND the render must still match flag-OFF. Debug ladder (set before
# launch to bisect a problem):
#   NHL_HIGHCUT_MT_SYNC=1       run the consumer on the CP thread (no worker)  -- isolates threading
#   NHL_HIGHCUT_MT_SYNC=1 + NHL_HIGHCUT_MT_LIVEREAD=1   sync + live read (no snapshot) -- the 1a path
